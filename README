The Winamp Remote Control

Consists of a plugin that is compatible with the winamp 2.5.x API, along with a client, allowing multiple users to share a centralised Winamp server.

Built using c++ Builder 5 onwards and uses MS-RPC for the communication mechanismm.

A linux client was created which worked fine, linked against the DCE-RPC runtime.

This project was active for a couple of years around 2000-2002 and produced a number of revisions that were externally released.

These code releases and the other related assets have been poured into git.

The project appears to have be quite popular for a while.
It targets the Winamp 2.5x API (beyond a certain level), and did not work completely with the Winamp 3 + legacy plugins adapter.
 
Some features of note were
 * network remote control clients
 * ability to minimize to the tray as a clickable icon
 * pause / stop / play
 * EQ and volume
 * playlist import / management with our friends drag and drop
 * automated discovery of servers on the network
 * and much, much, more ...
 
  The final blow was the Windows XP Service Pack which locked down security for unauthenticated RPC endpoints.
