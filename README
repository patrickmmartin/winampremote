The Winamp Remote Control

Consists of a plugin that is compatible with the winamp 2.5.x API, along with a client, allowing multiple users to share a centralised Winamp server.

Built using c++ Builder 5 onwards and uses MS-RPC for the communication mechanismm.

A linux client was created which worked fine.

The final blow was the Windows XP Service Pack which locked down security for unauthenticated RPC endpoints.
